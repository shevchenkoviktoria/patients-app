Overview
The Patient Management Application is a web application built using React and Material-UI for managing patient information, 
appointments, and interactions with a backend server. This system allows users to:

Add new patients
Update patient details
View a list of patients
Archive (delete) appointments
The application communicates with a backend API for data storage and retrieval. It supports CRUD operations for patient records and appointments, providing functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and archiving.

Features
1. Add New Patient
Form Fields:
Name
Date of Birth
Medical Condition
Next Appointment Date
After submission, a new patient record is created in the backend.
Success Message: Once a patient is added successfully, an alert is shown, and the patient's data is updated in the UI.
2. Update Patient
Users can edit patient details such as name, date of birth, medical condition, and appointment date.
Changes are reflected in the backend using an API PUT request.
3. Patient List
Displays a table of patients with their information.
Each row shows:
Patient Name
Date of Birth
Condition
Appointment Date
Users can delete patients or edit their details.
4. Appointments
View a list of patients with their upcoming appointment dates.
Each appointment can be archived (deleted) via the "Archive Appointment" button.
5. Search Patients
Search functionality allows users to filter patients by name.
Code Structure
Components:
AddPatient: A form for adding new patients.
PatientList: Displays a list of patients with options to edit and delete.
AppointmentList: Shows a list of patient appointments with options to archive (delete).
App: The main component that handles state management, rendering the UI based on the selected tab, and handles API communication.
Types:
Patients: Represents the patient data model.
Appointments: Represents the appointment data model.
Suggested Improvements
1. Using useQuery for Data Fetching
Currently, data fetching is done using axios inside useEffect, which works well but may have performance issues, especially when fetching data multiple times or when the app scales. A better approach would be to use the React Query library with useQuery for handling API requests efficiently. This library provides automatic caching, background data fetching, and updating, making the app more responsive and reducing redundant requests.

Example of useQuery for fetching patient data. This refactoring will:

Automatically cache the fetched data.
Automatically refetch the data when required (e.g., after a patient is added or deleted).
Reduce the need for manual useEffect hooks for data fetching.

2. Backend API Improvements
Get Patient ID for Editing: The current implementation does not explicitly fetch patient details by ID for editing. 
An improvement would be to implement an API endpoint that returns patient data based on the id. 
This would ensure that users are editing the correct patient record.

Get Appointment ID for Archiving: Similarly, archiving appointments can be improved by having a specific API endpoint that allows appointment management, 
including deleting (archiving) by appointment id.


3. Improve Error Handling and User Feedback
Currently, the app provides basic alert messages for success or failure. However, it can be improved by integrating more user-friendly feedback mechanisms, 
such as snackbars (using Material-UI) or modal popups to inform users of the success or failure of an operation. 
Additionally, network errors can be handled more gracefully by displaying informative messages to the user instead of generic alerts.
